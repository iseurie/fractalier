#Fractalier

_Fractalier_ is a web service allowing users to more thoroughly explore fractals, leveraging the power of the cloud to offload the prohibitive demand of extremely 
high-resolution and precise custom renderings. There are three components of the implementation, these being the fractal rendering and calculation, decoupled in 
the backend, and a <a href=https://github.com/iseurie/fractalier-rest>REST interface</a>, allowing HTTP requests to be made specifying parameters for fractal 
computations and rendering to generate bitmap resources which can then be served to clients and archived. A premium real-time implementation of RFC 6455 Websocket 
protocol is under consideration, as well as monetization under a 'freemium' model.
